Assume that there are ten children in a group.

Write a python script named sweets-per-child.py which reads a number
of sweets(an integer) and outputs the number of sweets each child
revieves.

Each child recieves the most sweets possible such that each child receives
the same number of sweets.

There may be some sweets left over.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

print(n // 10)
