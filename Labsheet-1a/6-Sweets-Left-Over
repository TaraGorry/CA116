Assume that there are ten children in a group.

Write a python script named sweets-left-over.py which reads a number
of sweets(an integer) and outputs the number of sweets left over after
the sweets have been given to the children.

Each child recieves the most sweets possible such that each child recieves
the same number of sweets.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n - int(input())

print(n % 10)
