For the purpose of this task, assume that any year which is divisible
by four is a leap year.

Standard input consists of a single integer, a year.

Write a python script named most-recent-leap-year.py which writes the
most recent leap year in or before that year to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

year = int(input())

print(year - (year % 4))
