Standard input consists of exactly four integers (one per line):

- first x1 and y1, the coordinates of the bottom-left courner of the rectangle,
- and then x2 and y2, the coordinates of the top-right corner.

Write a python script names area-of-rectangle.py which writes the area of the
rectangle to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(inpit())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())

print((x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1))
