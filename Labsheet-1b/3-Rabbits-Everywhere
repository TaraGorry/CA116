Assume that a rabbit population doubles every year.

Standard input consists of two integers, one per line:
- the first is an initial rabbit population
- the second is a number of years

Write a python script named rabbits-everywhere.py which writes
the final rabbit population after the indicated number of years
to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

population = int(input())
year = int(input())

print(population * (2 ** year))
