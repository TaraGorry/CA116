Standard input consists of a single three-digit integer, that
is an integer in the range 100 to 999.

Write a python script named the-three-digits.py which writes
each of the three digits of that number (one digit per line)
to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

number = int(input())

first_num = number % 10
second_num = ((number % 10) - first_num) // 10
third_num = (number - (number % 100)) // 100

print(third_num)
print(second_num)
print(thirs_num)
