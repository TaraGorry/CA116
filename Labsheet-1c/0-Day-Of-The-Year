A strange year:
Imagine an alternative world in which a year consists of 12 months,
as normal, but every month consists of ecactly 30 days.
Months are numbers from 1 to 12, and days from 1 to 30.
A week has seven days, as usual.
Week days start on a Monday, and are numbered 1 to 7.

Task:

Standard input consists of two integers, one per line:
A month number and a day-of-the-month number.

Write a python script named day-of-the-year.py which writes the day of the year to standard output.

The days of the year are numbers from 1 to 360.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

month = int(input())
day = int(input())

print(day + ((month - 1) * 30))
