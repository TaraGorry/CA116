Imagine an alternative world in which a year consists of 12 months,
as normal, but every month consists of exactly 30 days.
Months are numbered from 1 to 12, and days from 1 to 30.
A week has seven days, as usual.
Week days start on a Monday, and are numbered 1 to 7.

Standard input consists of a month number and a day-of-the-month
number, one per line.

Further, assume that the first day of the first month of the year
is a Monday.

Write a python script named day-of-the-week.py which writes the day
of the week to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

month = int(input())
day = int(input())

print((((day - 1) + (month - 1) * 30) % 7 ) + 1))
