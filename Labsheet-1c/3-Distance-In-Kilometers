Standard input consists of a single integer, a distance measured
in meters.

Write a python script named distance-in-kilometers.py which writes
the corresponding distance in kilometers to standard output.

Rounding:
- Round fractional kilometers of strictly less than 500m down to
the nearest kilometers, and greater than that up.
- For example, 7499m becomes 7km whereas 7500 becomes 8km.

Your solution may not use the python built-in function round().

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

meters = int(input())

print((meters // 1000) + ((meters % 1000) // 500))
