Standard input consists of exactly three digits, one per line.
Take these to be, respectively, the first, second and third digits 
of a three-digit number.

Write a python script named three-digit-number.py which writes that number to standard output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

digit_one = int(input())
digit_two = int(input())
digit_three = int(input())

print((digit_one * 100) + (digit_two * 10) + (digit_three))
