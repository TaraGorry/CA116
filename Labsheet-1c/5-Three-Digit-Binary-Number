Standard input consists of exactly three binary digits, one per line.

Take these to be, respectively, the first, second and third digits of a three-digit binary number.

Write a python script named three-digit-binary-number.py which writes that number to standard output in decimal.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

first = int(input())
second = int(input())
third = int(input())

print(third * (2 ** 0) + second * (2 ** 1) + first * (2 ** 2))
