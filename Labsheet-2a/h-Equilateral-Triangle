Standard input consists of exactly three positive integers, one
per line, these being the lengths of the side of a triangle.

Write a python script named equilateral-triangle.py which outputs
True if the triangle is an equilateral triangle, and False otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

side_1 = int(input())
side_2 = int(input())
side_3 = int(input())

print(side_1 == side_2 and side_1 == side_3 and side_2 == side_3)
