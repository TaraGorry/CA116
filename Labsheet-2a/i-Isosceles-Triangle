Standard input consists of exactly three positive integers, one
per line, these being the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

Write a python script named isosceles-triangle.py which outputs
True if the triangle is an isosceles triangle, and False otherwise.

For the purpose of this task, an equilateral triangle is also an
isosceles triangle.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

side_1 = int(input())
side_2 = int(input())
side_3 = int(input())

print(side_1 == side_2 or side_1 == side_3 or side_2 == side_3)
