Standard input consists of exactly three positve integers:
first the length of the longest side of a triangle, and then the lengths of the other two sides.

Each integer is on a separate line.

Write a python script named right-angled-triangle.py which outputs True if the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and False otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

c = int(input())
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print((c * c) == (a * a) + (b * b))
