Standard input consists of a single positive integer, mark say. This is the student's mark in an examination.

Any mark greater than or equal to 70% is a first, from 50% to 69% is a second, from 40% to 49% is a third, and anything less than 40% is a fail.

Write a python script named classifications.py which outputs four lines, one for each classification.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

mark = int(input())

if 40 > mark:
  print("first: False")
  print("second: False")
  print("third: False")
  print("fail: True")

elif 40 <= mark <= 49:
  print("first: False")
  print("second: False")
  print("third: True")
  print("fail: False")

elif 50 <= mark <= 69:
  print("first: False")
  print("second: True")
  print("third: False")
  print("fail: False")

elif 70 <= mark:
  print("first: True")
  print("second: False")
  print("third: False")
  print("fail: False")
