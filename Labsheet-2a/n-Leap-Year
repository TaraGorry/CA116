Standard input consists of a single positive integer, year say. This is a year.

Write a python script named leap-year.py which outputs a single Boolean: True if year is a leap year, and False otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

year = int(input())

print((year % 400 == 0) or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0))
