Standard input consists of a single integer, n say.

Write a python script named is-even.py which outputs True if 
n is even and False otherwise.

To make this task tricky...

Your solution may not use %, the modulus operator (and you may
only use elements of python which have been covered in the module
thus far).

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

num = int(input())

i = 0
if num < 0:
    num = num * -1

even = True
while i < num:
    if even is True:
        even = False
    else:
        even = True
    i = i + 1

print(even)
