Standard input consists of three integers, one per line. Take these
to be x, y and r, respectively the centre point of a circle and the
radius of that circle.

Write a python script named circle-overlaps-origin.py which outputs 
True if the origin is strictly contained within the circle, and False
otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

x = int(input())
y = int(input())
r = int(input())

print((x * x) + (y * y) < r * r)
