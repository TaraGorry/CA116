Standard input consists of three integers, one per line.
Call these a, b and c, respectively.

Write a python script named picker.py which outputs:
  - a if c is even, and
  - b if c is odd.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

result = (c % 2 == 0) * a + (c % 2 == 1) * b

print(result)
