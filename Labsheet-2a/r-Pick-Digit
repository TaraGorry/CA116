Background:
Consider the number 9876.
Here, we will define:
 - 6 to be the 0th digit,
 - 7 to be the 1st digit,
 - 8 to be the 2nd digit, and
 - 9 to be the 3rd digit.
In other words, we're counting the digits backwards, and starting from 0.

Task:
Standard input consists of two positive integers, one per line.

Take n to be the first integer, and p to be the second.

Write a python script named pick-digit.py which outputs the p-th digit of n.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = str(input())
p = int(input())

print(n[(len(n) - 1) - p])
