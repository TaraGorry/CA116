Standard input consists of a single integer value in the range 
0 to 6 (inclusive), where 0 is Monday.

Write a python script named weekend.py which outputs the message
"weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday, and the message "weekday"
otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

day = int(input())

if day == 5 or day == 6:
  print("weekend")
else:
  print("weekday")
