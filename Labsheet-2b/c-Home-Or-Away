Standard input consists of two integers, one per line: these are
respectively the scores of the home and the away teams in a football
(soccer) match.

Write a python script named home-win.py which outputs exactly one 
of the following three messages, as appropriate:

 - "Home win"
 - "Draw"
 - "Away win"

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

home = int(input())
away = int(input())

if home > away:
  print("Home win")
elif home == away:
  print("Draw")
else:
  print("Away win")
