Background:
Fizz-buzz is a children's counting game in which:
  - any number which is divisible by 3 is replaced with "fizz"
  - any number which is divisible by 5 is replaced with "buzz"

However, numbers which are divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced
with "fizz-buzz".

For all other numbers, just the number itself is said.

Task:
Standard input consists of a single integer.

Write a python script named fizz-or-buzz.py which outputs the 
appropriate fizz-buzz output for that integer.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

number = int(input())

if (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
  print("fizz-buzz")
elif number % 3 == 0:
  print("fizz")
elif number % 5 == 0:
  print("buzz")
else:
  print(number)
