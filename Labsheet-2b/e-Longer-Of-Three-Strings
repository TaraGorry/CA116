Standard inpput consists of exactly three lines of text.

Write a python script named longer-of-three-strings.py which 
outputs only the longer of the three strings.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
t = input()
r = input()

if (len(s) > len(t)) and (len(s) > len(r)):
  print(s)
elif (len(t) > len(s)) and (len(t) > len(r)):
  print(t)
else:
  print(r)
