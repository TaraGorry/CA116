Backround:
A prime number is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 which
is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Task:
Standard input consists of a small positive integer, n say; n is
strictly less than twenty.

Write a python script named small-primes.py which outputs either
the message "prime" or the message "not prime" depending upon whether
n is prime or not.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

if (n == 2) or (n == 3):
  print("prime")
elif (n % 2 == 0) or (n % 3 == 0) or (n == 1):
  print("not prime")
else:
  print("prime")
