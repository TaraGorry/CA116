Background:
The Hailstone sequence is a sequence of positive integers.

Task:
Standard input consists of a single positive integer, n say.

Write a python script named next-hailstone.py which outputs just the term following n in the Hailstone sequence.

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

if n * ((n + 1) % 2) == n:
  print(n // 2)
elif n * (n % 2) == n:
  print((3 * n) + 1)
