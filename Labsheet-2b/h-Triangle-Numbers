Background:
Take a, b and c to be the putative lengths of the sides of a 
triangle.

Some values of a, b and c can form triangles; 
for example, 3, 4 and 5.

Some other values of a, b and c cannot form a triangle;
for example 1, 2 and 100.

In the latter case, one of the sides is too long for the other
two, they cannot possibly reach each other to form a triangle.

In fact, even 3, 6 and 3 cannot form a triangle; 
the best they can do is form a line.

Task:
Standard input consists of three positive integers, a, b and c,
say, the putative lengths of the side of a triangle, one per line.

Write a python script named is-triangle.py which outputs either
the message "yes" or the message "no" depending upon whether a,
b and c can be lengths of the side of a triangle, or not.

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if ((a + b) > c) and ((c + b) > a) and ((a + c) > b):
  print("yes")
else:
  print("no")
