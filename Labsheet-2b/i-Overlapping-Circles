Standard input consists of six positive integers, x1, y1 and r1,
and x2, y2 and r2 say, the centres and radii of two circles.

Write a python script named overlapping-circles.py which outputs
either the message "yes" or the message "no" depending upon whether
the two circles overlap or not.

Touching circles are not considered to overlap.

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
r1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
r2 = int(input())

if ((x2 - x1) ** 2) + ((y2 - y1) ** 2) < (r2 + r1) ** 2:
  print("yes")
else:
  print("no")
