Background:
Boddy mass index (or BMI) is a measure used to assess whether a person
is underweight, overweight, obese or just right.

Specifically, given a person's weight (in kg) and their height (in cm), then their BMI is:
 - weight / (height * height) * 10000

According to BMI:
  - if your BMI is less than 18.5, your weight falls within the "underweight" range;
  - if your BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, it falls within the "normal" range;
  - if your BMI is 25.0 to 29.9, it falls within the "overweight" range;
  - if your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the "obese" range.

Task:
Standard input consists of two positive integers (one per line): 
first a weight (in kg), then a height (in cm)

Write a python script named bmi-calculator.py which writes the corresponding BMI category to standard output.

The output from your script will be one of the four words:
  - "underweight"
  - "normal"
  - "overweight"
  - "obese"

The four catagories are defined above.

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

weight = int(input())
height = int(input())

if (weight / (height * height) * 10000) <= 18.5:
  print("underweight")
elif (weight / (height * height) * 10000) <= 25:
  print("normal")
elif (weight / (height * height) * 10000) <= 30:
  print("overweight")
else:
  print("obese")
