Sequence:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

Solution:
#!/usr/bin/env python3

x = x + 1

Explanation:
If x is initally 0, the after executing this assignment statement,
x will be 1.

Then, if x is 1, after executing this assignment statement,
x will be 2.

And so on.

As the assignment statement is executed repeatedly, x takes on
each value in the sequence in turn.
