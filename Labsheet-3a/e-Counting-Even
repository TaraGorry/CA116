Task:
Write a script named counting-even.py which reads a positive 
integer n from standard input and outputs the first n even natural 
numbers, one per line.

(Take the natural numbers to be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on).

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

count = 0
i = 0
while i < n:
  print(count + 2)
  i = i + 1
  count = count + 2
