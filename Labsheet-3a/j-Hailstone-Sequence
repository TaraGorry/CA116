Task:
Standard input consists of two positive integers, n and m respectively.

Write a python script named hailstone-sequence-1.py which outputs
the n terms of the Hailstone sequence beginning with m.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())
m = int(input())

i = 0
while i < n:
  if i == 0:
    m = m
  elif m % 2 == 1:
    m = (3 * m) + 1
  else:
    m = m // 2
  print(m)
  i = i + 1
