Task:
From the solution to the Sequence Task 8, from labsheet 2c,
try this...

Write a python script named weird-sequence.py which reads a positive
integer n from standard input and outputs the first n trems of the 
sequence in the example, one per line.

Solution:

#!usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

i = 0
while i < n:
  sequence = ((-1) ** i) * (i)
  print(sequence)
  i += 1
