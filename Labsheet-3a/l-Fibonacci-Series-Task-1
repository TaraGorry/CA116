Task:
The Fibonacci series proceeds as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Each new term is the sum of the perceding two terms.


Write a python script named fib-n.py which reads positive integer n from standard input and outputs the first n terms of the Fibonacci series, one per line.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

if n <= 0:
  print(n)
else:
  a, b = 0, 1
  i = 0
  while i < n:
    print(a)
    a, b = b, a + b
    i += 1
