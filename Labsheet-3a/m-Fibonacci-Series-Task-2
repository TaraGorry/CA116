Task:
This task is different to all of the other tasks.
In this task, you do not know how many times your loop will iterate before beginning.
Therefore, our do-something-n-times loop pattern is not appropriate for this task.

Write a python script named fib-less-than-n.py which reads a positive integer n from standard input and outputs the sequence of Fibonacci numbers which are less than n, one per line.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

if n <= 0:
  print(n)
else:
  a, b = 0, 1
  while a < n:
    print(a)
    a, b = b, a + b
