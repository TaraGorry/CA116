Task:
Standard input consists of a single positive integer n, say.

Write a python script named factorial.py which writes n! to standard 
output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

if n < 0:
  print(n)
else:
  factorial = 1
  i = 1
  while i <= n:
    factorial *= i
    i += 1
  print(factorial)
