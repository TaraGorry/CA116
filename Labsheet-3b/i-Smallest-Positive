Task:
Write a python script named ten-smallest-positive.py which outputs 
only the smallest positive number encountered.

To simplify matters, you should assume that the first number is positive.

0 is not positive.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

smallest = 1

i = 0
while i < 10:
  n = int(input())
  if i == 0 or smallest > n and n > 0:
    smallest = n
  i += 1

print(smallest)
