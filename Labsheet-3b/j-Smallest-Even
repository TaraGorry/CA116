Task:
Write a python script named ten-smallest-even.py which outputs 
only the smallest even number encountered.

You should assume that the first number is even.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

smallest = 0

i = 0
while i < 10:
  n = int(input())
  if i == 0 or smallest > n and n % 2 == 0:
    smallest = n
  i = i + 1

print(smallest)
