For each of the following teaks, read a positive n from standard input, and write a python script which writes the indicated shape to standard output.

To avoid some difficulties, you should assume n is odd.

In each example, the input is 7.

Task:
Name your script shape-cross.py.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

i = 0
while i < n:
  if i == n // 2:
    print(n * "*")
  else:
    print((n // 2) * " " + "*")
  i = i + 1
