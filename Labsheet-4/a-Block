For each of the following teaks, read a positive n from standard input, and write a python script which writes the indicated shape to standard output.

To avoid some difficulties, you should assume n is odd.

In each example, the input is 7.

Task:
Name your script shape-block.py

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())

i = 0
while i < n:
  print("*" * n)
  i = i + 1
