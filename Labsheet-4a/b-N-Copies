Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text (s, say) followed 
on the next line by a non-negitave integer (n, say).

Write a python script named n-copies.py which outputs n copies of 
s on a single line (with no intervening space characters).

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
n = int(input())

print(s * n)
