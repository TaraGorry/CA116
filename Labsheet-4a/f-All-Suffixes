Background:
A suffix is any sequence of characters appearing at the end 
of a string.

For example, "stein" is a suffix of "Einstein".

A string of length n has n suffixes, including the string itself.

Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text.

Write a python script named all-suffixes.py which writes each 
suffix of that text to standard output, one per line. (from longest 
to shortest).

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  print(s[i:])
  i = i + 1
