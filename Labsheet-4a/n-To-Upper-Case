Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text.

Write a python script named to-upper-case.py which writes that text 
to standard output, but with all of the lower-case letters 
converted to the corresponding upper-case letters.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
t = ""

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  if "a" <= s[i] and s[i] <= "z":
    t = t + chr(ord(s[i]) - ord("a") + ord("A"))
  else:
    t = t + s[i]
  i = i + 1

print(t)
