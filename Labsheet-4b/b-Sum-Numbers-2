Task:
Write a python script named sum-five-0.py which is the same as 
that for the previous task, except that it reads an unknown number 
of integers.

Your script should stop when it encounters a line containing only 
0.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

n = int(input())
total = 0

while n != 0:
  total = total + n
  n = int(input())

print(total)
