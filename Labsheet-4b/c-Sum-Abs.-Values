Task:
Write a python script named sum-five-abs.py which reads exactly
five integers from standard input and outputs the sum of the
absolute values of those integers.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

total = 0

i = 0
while i < 5:
  n = int(input())
  if n < 0:
    n = n * (-1)
  total = total + n
  i = i + 1

print(total)
