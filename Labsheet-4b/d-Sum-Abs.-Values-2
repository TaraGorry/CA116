Task:
Write a python script named sum-five-abs-0.py which is the same 
as that for the previous task, except that it reads an unknown 
number of integers.

Your script should stop when it encounters a 0.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

total = 0

n = int(input())
while n != 0:
  if n < 0:
    n = n * (-1)
  total = total + n
  n = int(input())

print(total)
