Task:
Write a python script named sum-five-pos-neg.py which reads 
exactly five integers from standard input and outputs exactly two numbers:
- the sum of the negative numbers encountered
- the sum of the positive numbers encountered
.. on the same line.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

pos = 0
neg = 0

i = 0
while i < 5:
  num = int(input())
  if num > 0:
    pos = pos + num
  
  if num < 0:
    neg = neg + num
  i = i + 1

print(neg, pos)
