Task:
Write a python script named sum-five-pos-neg-0.py which is the 
same as that for the previous task, except that it reads an 
unknown number of integers.

Your script should stop when it encounters a 0.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

pos = 0
neg = 0

n = int(input())
while n != 0:
  if n > 0:
    pos = pos + n
    n = int(input())
  if n < 0:
    neg = neg + n
    n = int(input())

print(neg, pos)
