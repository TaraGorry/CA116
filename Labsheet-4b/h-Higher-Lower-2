Task:
Write a python script named higher-lower-0.py which is the same 
as the previous task, except that it reads an unknown number of 
integers.

Your script should stop when it encounters a 0.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

prev = int(input())

if prev != 0:
  curr = int(input())
  results = ""
  
  if curr != 0:
    
    while curr != 0:
      
      if results != "":
        results = results + "\n"
      
      if prev < curr:
        results = results + "higher"
      
      elif prev > curr:
        results = results + "lower"
      
      else:
        results = results + "equal"

      prev = curr
      curr = int(input())
    
    print(results)
