Background:
The musical notes are usually represented by the first seven letters 
of the alphabet, so a through to g.

Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text(without any upper-case letters).

Write a python script named first-musical-note.py which writes the first character of that text which is a musical note to standard output.

You should assume that a musical-note character does indeed occur within the text.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  if "a" <= s[i] and s[i] <= "g":
    print(s[i])
    i = len(s)
  else:
    i = i + 1
