Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text.

Write a python script named first-capital-letter.py which writes 
the position of the first capital letter in the text to standard output.

You should assume that a capital letter does indeed exist within the text.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  if "A" < s[i] and s[i] <= "Z":
    print(i)
    i = len(s)
  else:
    i = i + 1
