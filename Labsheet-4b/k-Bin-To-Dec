Task:
Standard input consists of a single positive binary number.

Write a python script named bin-to-dec.py which outputs that 
binary number in its decimal representation.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

total = 0

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  dec = (2 ** i) * int(s[len(s) - i - 1])
  total = total + int(dec)
  i = i + 1

print(total)
