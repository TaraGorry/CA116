Background:
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers is 
the largest positive integer which divides both without a remainder.

For example, the GCD of 75 and 30 is 15.

Euclid's Algorithm:
  - Start with two positive integers a and b.
  
  - Repeat the following steps:
    - the new a is the old b
    - the new b is the remainder after dividing the old a by the old b.
  
  - Stop when b is 0; the final value of a is the answer.

Task:
Write a python script named gcd.py which reads two positive integers and outputs their greatest common divisor.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

while b:
  a, b = b, a % b

print(a)
