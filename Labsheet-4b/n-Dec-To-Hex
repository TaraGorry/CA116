Background:
Hexadecimal (or "hex") is a base-16 number system in which we 
use the letters a through f to represent the base-16 "digits" 
10 through 15.

Task:
Standard input consists of a single decimal number.

Write a python script named dec-to-hex.py which outputs that 
decimal number as a hexadecimal number.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = int(input())

hex = hex(s)[2:]

print(hex)
