Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text s.

Write a python script named first-capital.py which writes the 
first upper-case letter in s and it's position to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if s does not contain a 
capital letter.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] < "A" or "Z" < s[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  print(s[i], i)
