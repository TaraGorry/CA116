Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text s.

Write a python script named first-non-space.py which writes 
just the position of the first non-space character in s to 
standard output.

Your script should output "-1" if s does not contain a non-space
character.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] == " "):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  print(i)
else:
  print("-1")
