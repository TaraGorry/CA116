Task:
Standard input consists of s single line of text s.

Write a python script named first-number.py which writes the 
first number in s and it's position to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if s does not contain a 
number.

Take a number to be any contiguous sequence of one or more 
digits.

You must include all contiguous digits in your output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] < "0" or "9" < s[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and ("0" <= s[j] and s[j] <= "9"):
    j = j + 1
  print(s[i:j], i)
