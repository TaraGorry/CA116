Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text s.

Write a python script named first-acronym.py which writes the 
first acronym in s and its position to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if s does not contain an 
acronym.

Take an acronym to be any contiguous sequence of one or more 
upper-case letters.

You must include all contiguous capital letters in your output.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] < "A" or "Z" < s[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and ("A" <= s[j] and s[j] <= "Z"):
    j = j + 1
  print(s[i:j], i)
