Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text s.

Write a python script named first-pair.py which writes the first 
pair of adjacent identical characters in s to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if s does not contain such 
a pair.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 1
while i < len(s) and (s[i] != s[i - 1]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  print(s[i - 1: i + 1])
