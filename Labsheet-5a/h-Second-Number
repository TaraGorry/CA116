Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text s.

Write a python script named second-number.py which writes the 
second number in s and its position to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if s does not contain at 
lease two numbers.

Take a number as defined previously.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] < "0" or "9" < s[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and (s[j] >= "0" or "9" <= s[j]):
    j = j + 1
    k = j
    while k < len(s) and (s[k] < "0" or "9" < s[k]):
      k = k + 1
    if i < len(s):
      n = k
      while n < len(s) and (s[n] >= "0" or "9" <= s[n]):
        n = n + 1
  print(s[k:n], k)
