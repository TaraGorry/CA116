Background:
"A palindrome is a word or text which reads the same backwards 
and forwards."

For example: "rotator"

Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text containing a 
word w.

Write a python script named palindrome-string.py which writes 
the message "palindrome" to standard output if w is a palindrome, 
and produces no output otherwise.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

w = input()

i = 0
while i < len(w) and (w[i] < "a" and "z" < w[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(w):
  j = i
  while j < len(w) and (w[j] == w[len(w) - 1 - j]):
    j = j + 1
  if j == len(w):
    print("palindrome")
