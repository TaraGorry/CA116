Task:
Standard input consists of a single line of text, that text being 
a floating-point number f.

Write a python script named parse-float.py which writes the integer 
part of f and the fractional part of f to standard output, each 
on its own line.

Assume that neither the integer part nor the fractional part of f 
is ever empty.

The following words may not appear in your solutuon: "int", "float" and "split".

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s) and (s[i] < "0" or "9" < s[i]):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and ("0" <= s[j] and s[j] <= "9"):
    j = j + 1
    k = j
  print(s[i:j])
while k < len(s) and (s[k] < "0" and "9" < s[k]):
  k = k + 1
if i < len(s):
  n = k
  while n < len(s) and ("0" <= s[n] and s[n] <= "9"):
    n = n + 1
print(s[k:n])
