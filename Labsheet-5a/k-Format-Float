Task:
Standard input consists of a number.

That number:
  - May be positive or negative
  - May be an integer of a floating-point number
  - And if it is a floating-point number, then the integer part 
    or the fractional part may be empyt (but not both).

There are no whitespace characters in the input.

Write a python script named format-float.py which writes the 
same number to standard output formatted as a floating-point 
number in which both the integer part and thr fractional part 
are present.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()

is_negative = False
if s[0] == "-":
  is_negative = True
  s = s[1:]

if "." not in s:
  s = s + ".0"
elif s[0] == ".":
  s = "0" + s
elif s[-1] == ".":
  s = s + "0"

if is_negative:
  s = "-" + s

print(s)
