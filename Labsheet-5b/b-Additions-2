Task:
Standard input consists of a single addition on a single line 
involving exactly five integer terms.

Write a python script named additions-2.py which writes the 
resulting sum to standard output.

Example input:
271+9730+30+813+5

Example output:
10849

** Your solution must involve exactly two while loops, one 
nested inside the other. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
total = 0
i = 0
j = 0
while j < len(s):
  while j < len(s) and ("0" <= s[j] and s[j] <= "9"):
    i = i * 10 + int(s[j])
    j = j + 1
  total = total + i
  i = 0
  j = j + 1
print(total)
