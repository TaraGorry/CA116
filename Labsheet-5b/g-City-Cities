Task:
The last word in some of the city names is "City"; for example, 
Salt Lake City.

Write a python script named city-cities.py which writes only 
the name of each such city to standard output.

Example output:
Valley City
Salt Lake City

** This is easiest if you find the first comma, and then look backwards from there. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
while s != "end":
  i = 0
  while i < len(s) and s[i] != ",":
    i = i + 1
  city = s[i - 4:i]
  full_city = s[:i]
  if city == "City" and len(city) < len(full_city):
    print(full_city)
  s = input()
