CSV fields:
With CSV data, it is common that the first line is a header.

The header describes the meaning of each field.

Task:
Write a python script named csv-fields.py which writes the name of each header field to standard output.

Example standard input:
City,State,LatD,LatM,LatS,NS,LonD,LonM,LonS,EW
Example standard output
City
State
LatD
LatM
LatS
NS
LonD
LonM
LonS
EW

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
i = 0
while i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and s[j] != ",":
    j = j + 1
  print(s[i:j])
  i = i + 1
