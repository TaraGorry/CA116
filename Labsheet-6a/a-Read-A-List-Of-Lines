Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, terminated by 
a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named lines-to-list.py which writes those 
lines to standard output as a list literal.

Example input:
Nobody
expects
the
Spanish Inquisition!
end

Example output:
["Nobody", "expects", "the", "Spanish Inquisition!"]

** If you have a list a containing the lines as required, then 
write your output as follows:

print(a) **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
s = input()
while s != "end":
  a.append(s)
  s = input
print(a)
