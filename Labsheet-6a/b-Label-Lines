Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, terminated by 
a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named lable-lines.py which writes each 
line labelled with its position in the sequence and the total 
number of lines in the sequence to standard output.

Example input:
Nobody
expects
theSpanish Inquisition!
end

Example output:
0 4 Nobody
1 4 expects
2 4 the
3 4 Spanish Inquisition!

** The first column in the output is the position of the line 
in the list, the second column is the total number of lines 
(4, in this case).
You cannot know the total number of lines until you have read 
all of the lines.
Therefore you cannot produce the first line of output until you 
have read the last line of the input.
Therefore, you will have to store the lines in a list. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
s = input()
while s != "end":
  a.append(s)
  s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(a):
  print(i, len(a), a[i])
  i = i + 1
