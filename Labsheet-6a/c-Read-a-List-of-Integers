Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of integers, one per line, 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named lines-to-list-ints.py which writes 
those lines to standard output as a list literal.

Example input:
5
2
8
end

Example output:
[5, 2, 8]

** Each line of input either an integer or the text "end".
Because, each line might contain the text "end", you will have 
to read each line as a string with input(), and convert that 
string to an integer with int() only once you know that it does 
not contain the text "end".
Again, if you have a list a containing the integers as required 
the write your output as follows:
print(a) **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
s = input()
while s != "end":
  a.append(int(s))
  s = input()
print(a)
