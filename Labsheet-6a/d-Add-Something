Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of integers, one per line, 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end", and followed 
then by one further integer, n say.

Write a python script named add-something.py which, for each integer 
m in the original sequence, writes m + n to standard output.

Example input:
10
5
2
"end"
3

Example output:
13
8
5

** Again here, you cannot know the first line of output until you have read the last line of input.
Therefore, you must store each number in a list.
To read the input, read the integers storing them in a list until you encounter the text "end" - as before - and the simply read one more line:
a = []
# Read integers into (a) until encountering the text "end", as before.
n = int(input()) # Read the final integer, n.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
m = input()
while m != "end":
  a.append(m)
  m = input()

n = input()
i = 0
while i < len(a):
  total = int(a[i]) + int(n)
  print(total)
  i = i + 1
