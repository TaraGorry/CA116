Task:
The command-line arguments consists of a sequence of integers.

Write a python script named add-args.py which writes just the 
sum of those integers to standard output.

Example invocation:
$ python3 add-args.py 1 2 3

Example output:
6

** sys.argv is always a list of strings.
You will have to convert each element to and integer with int() in order to sum them. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

args = sys.argv[1:]

total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(args):
  total = total + int(args[i])
  i = i + 1
print(total)
