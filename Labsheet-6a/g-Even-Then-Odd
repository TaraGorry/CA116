Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of integers, one per line, 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named even-then-off.py which writes first 
all of the even numbers encountered to standard output (one per line), 
and the all of the odd numbers.

Example input:
3
7
2
5
6
end

Example output:
2
6
3
7
5

** You can print the even numbers out as you encounter them.
You cannot print the odd numbers as you go along, because you 
may yet encounter another even number.
Therefore you will have to save the odd numbers in a list, and 
print them out after you have read all of the input. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

odd = []
even = []

s = input()
while s != "end":
  num = int(s)
  if num % 2 == 0:
    even.append(num)
  else:
    odd.append(num)
  s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(even):
  print(even[i])
  i = i + 1

i = 0
while i < len(odd):
  print(odd[i])
  i = i + 1
