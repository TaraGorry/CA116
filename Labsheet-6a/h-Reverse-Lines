Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, terminated by 
a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named reverse-lines.py which writes those 
lines to standard output in reverse order.

Example input:
the lamb was sure to go.
And everywhere that Mary went
its fleece was white as snow.
Mary had a little lamb
end

Example output:
Mary had a little lamd
its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
cur = ""
while cur != "end":
  s = input()
  a.append(s)
  cur = s

i = len(a) - 1
while i > 0:
  i = i + 1
  print(a[i])
