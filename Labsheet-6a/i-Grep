Background:
grep is the name of a standard Unix utility.

grep filter lines of text, including in the output only those 
lines which contain some pattern.

The unusual-sounding name stands for global regular expression point.

Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Further, assume a single command-line argument, a pattern.

Write a python script named grep-lines.py which copies the input lines to standard output, but incluging in the output only those lines which contain pattern.

Example invocation:
$ python3 grep-lines.py Mary

Example input:
Mary had a little lamb,
it's fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go.
end

Example output:
Mary had a little lamb,
And everywhere that Mary went

** This is a linear-search problem **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

pattern = sys.argv[1]

line = input()
while line != "end":
  if pattern in line:
    print(line)
  line = input()
