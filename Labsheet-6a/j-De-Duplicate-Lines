Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, terminated by 
a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named de-dup-lines.py which writes only 
the first occurrence of each line to standard output.

Subsequent duplicates are skipped.

Example input:
red herring
blue
red herring
green
green
end

Example output:
red herring
blue
green

** Store the lines which you have already seen in a list and, 
for each new line encountered, first cheak whether the new line 
occurs in that list.
This is a list and linear-search problem. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

lines_seen = []
line = input()
while line != "end":
  if lines_seen.count(line) == 0:
    print(line)
    lines_seen.append(line)
  line = input()
