Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of digits, one per line, 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named histogram.py which writes a histogram 
of the frequency of occurrence of each digit to standard output.

Example input:
0
9
6
2
3
0
8
4
2
1
8
4
9
8
3
1
6
8
9
7
4
end

Example output:
0 **
1 **
2 **
3 **
4 ***
5
6 **
7 *
8 ****
9 ***

** There were four eights in the example input, but just one 
seven and no fives at all; hence the number of asterisks in 
each line of the histogram.
The histogram is on its side. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

counts = [0] * 10
line = input()
while line != "end":
  digit = int(line)
  counts[digit] += 1
  line = input()

digit = 0
while digit < 10:
  count = counts[digit]
  if count > 0:
    print(f"{digit} {'*' * count}")
  else:
    print(f"{digit}" + " ")
  digit += 1
