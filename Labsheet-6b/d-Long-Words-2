Task:
Assume an existing list of words (strings) named a.

Write a python fragment named long-words-2.py which writes the first long word in a to standard output.

As before, take a long word to be any word with six or more characters.

Your script should produce no output if a does not contain any long words.

Example list:
a = ["cat", "elephant", "mouse", "lizard", "horse", "mongoose"]

Example output:
elephant

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__ == "__main__":
  a = ["cat", "elephant", "mouse", "lizard", "horse", "mongoose"]

i = 0
while (i < len(a)) and (len(a[i]) < 6):
  i = i + 1
if i < len(a):
  print(a[i])
