Write a python fragment named prefix-2.py which writes the first word in a for which s is a prefic to standard output.

Your script should produce no output if a does not conatin any matching words.

Example list and string:

if __name__ == "__main__":
  a = ["mountain", "montagne", "mont", "mo", "montages", "zebra", "monthly"]
  s = "mont"

i = 0
while i < len(a) and a[i][0:len(s)] != s:
  i = i + 1
if i < len(a):
  print(a[i])
