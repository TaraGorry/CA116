Task:
Assume an existing non-empty list a.

Write a python fragment named swap-first-and-last.py which swaps the first and last elements in a.

Example list:
a = [8, 9, 4, 7, 2, 11]

Example list after execution:
a = [11, 9, 4, 7, 2, 8]

** The swap must be done in place, rearraging the elements of the existing list a.
You should not create a new list.
Your fragment should not write any output. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
t = ""

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  x = s[0]
  y = s[1:(len(s) - 1)]
  x = s[len(s) - 1]
  t = z + y + x
  i = i + 1
print(t)
