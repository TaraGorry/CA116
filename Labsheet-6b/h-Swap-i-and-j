Task:
Assume an existing non-empty list a, and two existing integer variables i and j.

Write a python fragment named swap-list-i-and-j.py which swaps the element in a at position i and j.

Example list:
a = [8, 9, 4, 7, 2, 11]
i = 1
j = 2

Example list after execution:
a = [8, 4, 9, 7, 2, 11]

** As before, The swap must be done in place, rearranging the elements of the existing list a.
You should not create a new list.
Your fragment should not write any output. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__ == "__main__":
  a = a = [8, 9, 4, 7, 2, 11]
  i = 1
  j = 2

temp = a[i]
p = a[j]
a[j] = temp
a[i] = p
