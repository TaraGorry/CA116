Task:
Standard input consists of two lists of integers, both 
individually sorted into increasing numerical order. Both 
lists are terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Wriet a python script named merge-sorted-lists.py which writes 
the numbers from both lists combined into sorted order to standard 
output.

Example Standard Input:
2
8
23
89
end
3
23
23
67
90
end

Example Standard Output:
2
3
8
23
23
23
67
89
90

** Tips:
Do not sort the lists (e.g. using selecting sort). Selection 
sort is O(n^2), whereas there is a simple and elegant O(n) 
solution to this task.
You will need to iterate over both lists at the same time.
The start of your main loop will look something like this:
i = 0
j = 0
while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
  # Print either a[i] or b[i], depending upon which is the smaller; then increment either i or j, as approprite, but not both. 
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
b = []

s = input()
while s != "end":
  a.append(int(s))
  s = input()

s = input()
while s != "end":
  b.append(int(s))
  s = input()

i = 0
j = 0
while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
  if a[i] < b[j]:
    print(a[i])
    i = i + 1
  else:
    print(b[j])
    j = j + 1

if len(a) != len(b):
  if len(a) < len(b):
    while j < len(b):
      print(b[j])
      j = j + 1
  elif len(b) < len(a):
    while i < len(a):
      print(a[i])
      i = i + 1
