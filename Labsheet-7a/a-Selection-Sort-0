Task:
Standard input consists of a non-empty sequence of integers 
terminated by a line containing only text "end".

Write a python script named selection-sort-0.py which reads 
those integers into a list, and then writes only the smallest 
element in that list to standard output.

** It is not strictly necessary to read the values into a list here, because you can find the smallest element in a sequence in one pass.
You should nevertheless do so, as this task is perparatory to other selection-sort tasks which absolutely do require that data to be read into a list. **

Example input:
49
32
39
31
30
12
14
19
13
31
end

Example output:
12

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
t = input()
while t != "end":
  a.append(int(t))
  t = input

p = 0
j = 1
while j < len(a):
  if a[j] < a[p]:
    p = j
  j = j + 1
print(a[p])
