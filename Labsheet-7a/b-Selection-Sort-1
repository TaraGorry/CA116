Task:
Standard input consists of a non-empty sequence of integers 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end", as before.

Write a python script named selection-sort-1.py which reads 
those integers into a list, and the writes only the position 
of the smallest element in that list to standard output.

In the case of duplicate smallest values, then prefer lowest-numbered position.

Example Input:
49
32
39
31
30
12
14
19
13
31
end

Example Output:
5

** Above the element at position 5 (which is 12) is the smallest value in the list.
It is not technically nescessary to use a list to complete this task; however, you must nevertheless do so. It matters for subsequent tasks. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
t = input()
while t != "end":
  a.append(t)
  t = input()

p = 0
j = 1
while j < len(a):
  if a[j] < a[p]:
    p = j
  j = j + 1
print(p)
