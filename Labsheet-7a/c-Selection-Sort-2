Task:
Standard input consists of a non-empty sequence of integers 
terminated by a line containing only the text "end", and 
followed then by exactly one further integer, i say.

Write a python script named selection-sort-2.py which writes 
only the position of the smallest element in the list from 
position i to the end of standard output.

In the case of duplicate smallest values, prefer the lowest-numbered position.

Example Input:
49
32
39
31
30
12
14
19
13
31
end
6

Examply Output:
8

** We only consider the values from position 6 to the end, so 14, 19, 13 and 31.
Of these, 13 is the smallest; 13 is at position 8. **

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
t = input()
while t != "end":
  a.append(int(t))
  t = input()

i = int(input())
j = i + 1
while j < len(a):
  if a[j] < a[i]:
    i = j
  j = j + 1
print(i)
