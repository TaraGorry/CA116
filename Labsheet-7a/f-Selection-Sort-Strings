Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines terminated by a 
line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named selection-sort-strings.py which 
outputs those lines in increasing lexicographical order.

Example input:
dog
cat
mouse
horse
balloon
end

Example output:
balloon
cat
dog
horse
mouse

** Lexicographical order is the default order for python's 
comparison operators when the operands are strings.
You do not need to do anything special in this regard.
the task should not take long to complete; if it takes longer 
than two minutes, then you're doing it wrong. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
t = input()
while t != "end":
  a.append(t)
  t = input()

i = 0
while i < len(a):
  p = 0
  j = 1
  while j < len(a):
    if a[j] < a[p]:
      p = j
    j = j + 1
  print(a[p])
  a.pop(p)
