Background:
The median of a data set is the middle value in the data set - the value which most-equally partitions the data set into high values and low values.

Task:
Standard input consists of a non-empty sequence of integers terminated by a line containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named median.py which writes only the median valye to standard output.

If there are two equally-good candidates (i.e. if there is an even number of values), the choose the higher value of the two. See both examples below. (This is a simplification; is should not make matters more complicated.)

Example Input 1:
9
6
3
1
7
8
3
end

Example output 1:
6

** There are three values grater than 6 in the list (7, 8 and 9), and three values less than 6 (1, 3 and 3). So, 6 most-equally partitions the list into hight values and low values.

Example input 2:
9
6
3
1
10
7
8
3
end

Example output 2:
7

** Here, 6 and 7 are equally-good median candidates. The task statement requires that you choose the higher value, so you choose 7. **

** The stipulation that you choose the higher of two equally good candidates is actually the simplest possible version of this problem.
If you find yourself writing significant logic to do this, then you are doing it wrong. **
