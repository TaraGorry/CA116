Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines terminated by 
a line containing only the text "end". Each line contains a 
person's date of birth followed by their name.

Write a python script named sorted-by-age.py which writes each person's name to standard output, ordered by their date of birth.

** You should assume the following:
  - The day, month and year of birth are always given with exactlt two digits; so somebody born on the eighth of the month, the day will be 08 (never just 8).
  - The lines do not contain any extraneous whitespace; so, the first character of each person's name is always at position 9. **

Example input:
08/01/35 Elvis Presley
01/02/68 Lisa Marie Presley
24/05/41 Robert Allen Zimmerman
05/05/88 Adele Laurie Blue Adkins
18/12/75 Sia Kate Isobelle Furler
01/03/94 Justin Bieber
10/05/60 Paul David Hewson
end

Example output:
Elvis Presley
Robert Allen Zimmerman
Paul David Hewson
Lisa Marie Presley
Sia Kate Isobelle Furler
Adele Laurie Blue Adkins
Justin Bieber

** Do not rush into this task; think about it.
A good solution does not require any change to your sorting algorithm at all.
It is sometimes better to manipulate that data to fit the logic, rather than changing the logic itself. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

a = []
t = input()
while t != "end":
  a.append(t)
  t = input()

i = 0
names = len(a)
b = []
while i < names:
  p = 0
  j = 1
  i = i + 1
  while j < len(a):
    if a[j][6:8] < a[p][6:8]:
      p = j
    elif a[j][6:8] == a[p][6:8]:
      if a[j][0:2] < a[p][0:2]:
        p = j
    j = j + 1
  b.append(a[p][9:])
  a.pop(p)

k = 0
while k < len(b):
  print(b[k])
  k = k + 1
