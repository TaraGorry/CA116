Task:
Standars input consists of CSV data, with the first line being 
a comma-separated header line.

Assume a single command-line argument, the position of one of 
the header fields.

Write a python script named csv-field-name.py which outputs 
only the name of the field at the indicated position.

Example Invocation:
python3 csv-field-name.py 3

Example Standard Input:
LatD,LatM,LatS,NS,LonD,LonM,LonS,EW,City,State
41,5,59,N,80,39,0,W,Youngstown,OH
42,52,48,N,97,23,23,W,Yankton,SD
.
.
.

Example Standard Output:
NS

** The field "NS" is at position 3, counting from 0.
For this task, we only care about the first line of the input.
You should assume that a field exists at the indicated position.

import sys

# The first command-line argument is at position 1...
#
position = int(sys.argb[1]) **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

position = int(sys.argv[1])
a = []
s = input()

i = 0
while i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and s[j] != ",":
    j = j + 1
  a.append(s[i:j])
  i = i + 1

print(a[position])
