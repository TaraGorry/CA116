Task:
Standard input consists of CSV data, with the first line being 
a comma-separated header line.

Assume a single command-line argument, being the name of one 
of the header fields.

Write a python script named csv-field-position.py which outputs 
only the position of the indicated field.

Example Invocation:
python3 csv-field-position.py NS

Example Standard Input:
LatD,LatM,LatS,NS,LonD,LonM,LonS,EW,City,State
41,5,59,N,80,39,0,W,Youngstown,OH
42,52,48,N,97,23,23,W,Yankton,SD
.
.
.

Example Standard Output:
3

** The field "NS" is at position 3, counting from 0.
For this task, we only care about the first line of the input.
You should assume that a field with the indicated name exists.
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
name = sys.argv[1]

s = input()
a = []
i = 0
while i < len(s):
  j = i
  while j < len(s) and s[j] != ",":
    j = j + 1
  a.append(s[i:j])
  i = i + 1

i = 0
while i < len(a):
  if a[i] == name:
    print(i)
  i = i + 1
