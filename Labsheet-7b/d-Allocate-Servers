Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of integers (one per line) 
representing the arrival times of jobs (in milliseconds). The 
input is sorted by arrival time and terminated by a line 
containing only the text "end".

Write a python script named allocate-servers.py which calculates 
the minimum number of servers nescessary to process the workload.

Example Standard Input 1:
100
200
300
end

Example Standard Output 1:
3

Example Standard Input 2:
100
200
1500
end

Example Standard Output 2:
1

** This is a linear search problem. You just have to figure 
out how to structure it as such. **

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
a = []
n = 0

while s != "end":
  a.append(int(s))
  current = 0
  i = 0
  while i < len(a):
    if int(s) <= a[i] + 1000:
      current += 1
      if n < current:
        n = current
    i = i + 1
  s = input()

print(n)
