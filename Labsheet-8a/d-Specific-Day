Task:
Following the timetable data, standard input contains exactly 
one additional line containing an integer, specifically a day 
of the week. Call this "day".

Write a python script named tt-day.py which, for each timetable 
entry, writes only the timetable lines for "day" to standard 
output.

Example Standard Input:
2 14 2 ca200 l114 Quantitative Analysis for Business Decisions
2 09 1 ca227 l101 Business Data Management I
3 11 2 ca277 lg26 Programming Fundamentals I
4 10 2 ca227 c114 Business Data Management I
end
2

Example Standard Output:
2 14 2 ca200 l114 Quantitative Analysis for Business Decisions
2 09 1 ca227 l101 Business Data Management I

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

timetable = []
line = input()
while line != "end":
  timetable.append(line)
  line = input()

day = input()
i = 0
while i < len(timetable):
  tokens = timetable[i].split()
  if tokens[0] == day:
    print(" ".join(tokens[0:]))
  i = i + 1
