Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines of text, 
terminated by a line containing only "end".

Write a python script named one-sentence-per-line.py which 
writes each sentence encountered to standard output on a 
separate line.

Sentences are terminated by full stops; you need not consider 
question marks, exclamation marks, and so on.

Example Standard Input:
Mary
   had
a
little lamb. Its      fleece was white as snow.And everywhere
that

   Mary went.
the lamb
was                      sure to

go.

end

Example Standard Output:
Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
the lamb was sure to go.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

s = input()
t = ""
while s != "end":
  t = t + " " + s
  s = input()

t = " ".join(t.split()).split(".")

i = 0
while i < len(t):
  if len(t[i]) > 0:
    if t[i][0] == " ":
      t[i] = t[i][1:]
  if t[i] != "":
    print(t[i] + ".")
  i = i + 1
