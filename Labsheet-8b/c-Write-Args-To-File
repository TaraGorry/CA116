Task:
Assume that the first command-line argument is a file name, 
and that the remaining command-line arguments are words.

Write a python script named write-args.py which writes each 
word to the named file, one per line.

Example Invocation:
$ python3 write-args.py some-file.txt one two three

Resulting Contents of some-file.txt:
one
two
three

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
file_name = sys.argv[1]
words = sys.argv[2:]

with open(file_name, "w") as f:
  i = 0
  while i < len(words):
    f.write(words[i] + "\n")
    i += 1
