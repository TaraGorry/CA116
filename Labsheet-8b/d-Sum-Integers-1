Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of integers, one per line.

Write a python script named sum-integers-1.py which writes the 
sum of those integers to standard output.

Example Standard input:
3
10
5
7

Example Standard Output:
25

**
Note that there is no "end" marker in the input.
Therefore, you cannot use the read-until-end or read-until-0 
approach which we have used previously. You will have to use one of the file methods for reading from file objects.

import sys

s = sys.stdin.readline()

OR

a = sys.stdin.readlines()

OR

a = sys.stdin.read().split()
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
s = sys.stdin.readlines()

total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(s):
  total += int(s[i])
  i += 1

print(total)
