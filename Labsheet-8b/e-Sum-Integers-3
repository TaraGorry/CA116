Task:
Assume that the command-line arguments are a sequence of file 
names, and that each file contains a sequence of integers, one 
per line.

Write a python script named sum-integers-2.py which writes 
the sum of all of those integers to standard output.

Example Invocation:
$ pythons sum-integers-3.py numbers-1.txt numbers-2.txt

Example Contents of numbers-1.txt:
3
10
5
7

Example Contents of numbers-2.txt:
2
8

Example Standard Output:
35

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
args = sys.argv[1:]

total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(args):
  with open(args[i]) as f:
    t = f.readlines()
    j = 0
    while j < len(t):
      total += int(t[j])
      j += 1
  i += 1
