Task:
Assume that the command-line arguments are a sequence of file 
named, and that each file conatins a whitespace-separated 
sequence of integers.

Write a python script named sum-integers-4.py which writes the 
sum of all of those integers to standard output.

Example Invocation:
$ python3 sum-integers-4.py numbers-1.txt numbers-2.txt

Example Contents of numbers-1.txt:
3
10 5
7

Example Contents of numbers-2.txt:
2
8 19 1

Example Standard Output:
55

**
If you choose the correct approach, then the solution to this task can be quite trivial.
Consider all of the ways which you could represent the data integnally; one of them leads to a concise solution.
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
args = sys.argv[1:]

total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(args):
  with open(args[i]) as f:
    s = f.readlines()
    j = 0
    while j < len(s):
      t = s[j].strip().split()
      k = 0
      while k < len(t):
        value = int(t[k])
        total += value
        k += 1
      j += 1
  i += 1

print(total)
