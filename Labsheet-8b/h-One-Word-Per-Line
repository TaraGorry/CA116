Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines, and each line 
consists of a sequence of whitespace-delimited words.

Write a python script named one-word-per-line.py which writes 
each of those words to standard output, one per line.

Your solution must not use a loop.

Example Standard Input:
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.

Example Standard Output:
Mary
had
a
little
lamb,
its
fleece
was
white
as
snow.

**
Take a "word" to be a contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters.

There is a simple solution to this task which does not require the use of a while loop at all.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

print(*sys.stdin.read().split, sep="\n")
