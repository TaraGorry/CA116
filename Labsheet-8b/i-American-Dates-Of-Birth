Task:
The current working directory contains a file named 
irish-dobs.txt. The format of that file is as indicated in the example below. Specifically, the dates of birth are in the Irish or European format, in which the day percedes the month.

Write a python script named american-dobs.py which writes a new file named american-dobs.txt in which the month precedes the day (this is the American way of writing dates).

Example Contents irish-dobs.txt (Your Input):
8/1/35 Elvis Presley
1/2/68 Lisa Marie Presley
24/5/41 Robert Allen Zimmerman
5/5/88 Adele Laurie Blue Adkins
18/12/75 Sia Kate Isobelle Furler
1/3/94 Justin Bieber
1/5/60 Paul David Hewson

Example contents american-dobs.txt (Your Output):
1/8/35 Elvis Presley
2/1/68 Lisa Marie Presley
5/24/41 Robert Allen Zimmerman
5/5/88 Adele Laurie Blue Adkins
12/18/75 Sia Kate Isobelle Furler
3/1/94 Justin Bieber
5/1/60 Paul David Hewson

**
You will have to pick apart the contents of each line with str.split(), and then reassemble the output line in the required format with str.join().
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

input_file = "irish-dobs.txt"
output_file = "american-dobs.txt"

with open(input_file) as f_in:
  with open(output_file, "w") as f_out:
    lines = f_in.readline()
    while 0 < len(lines):
      a = lines.split()
      date = a[0].split("/")
      day = lines.split()[0].split("/")[0]
      month = lines.split()[0].split("/")[1]
      date[0] = month
      date[1] = day
      new_date = "/".join(a)
      a[0] = new_date
      form_lines = " ".join(a)
      f_out.write(form_lines + "\n")
      lines = f_in.readline()
