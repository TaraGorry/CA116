Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of words, one per line.

Write a python script named fruit.py which outputs words 
encountered which are fruits, one per line.

For our purposes, there are only five fruits: apple, pear, orange, banana and cherry.

Your solution must make good use of a dictonary.

Example Standard Input:
dog
cat
apple
snake
cherry
dog
cherry
cat
pear
horse

Example Standard Output:
apple
cherry
cherry
pear

Tip, Perhaps start as follows:
fruit = {
   "apple": True,
   "pear": True,
   "orange": True,
   "banana": True,
   "cherry": True,
}

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
words = sys.stdin.read().split()

a = "apple pear orange banana cherry".split()
fruit = {}

i = 0
while i < len(a):
  fruit[a[i]] = True
  i += 1

i = 0
while i < len(words):
  word = words[i]
  if words in fruit:
    print(word)
  i += 1
