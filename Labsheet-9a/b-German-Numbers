Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of words, one per line.
Each word is an English-language number word; for example 
"three".

Write a python script named german-numbers.py which translates 
each English-language number word into the corresponding 
German-languagr number word; for example "drei".

All of the number words are in the range one to ten, and all 
are lower case.

Your solution must make good use of dictionary.

Example Standard Input:
one
three
seven
one

Example Standard Output:
eins
drei
sieben
eins

German Numbers:
eins zwei drei vier funf sechs sieben acht neun zehn

English Numbers:
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

**
Use a dictonary to store the word translations: the keys are the English number words, and the values are the corresponding German number words.
**

Solution:

#!/sur/bin/env python3

import sys
word = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

a = "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten".split()
b = "eins zwei drei vier funf sechs sieben acht neun zehn".split()
numbers = {}

i = 0
while i < len(a):
  numbers[a[i]] = b[i]
  i += 1

while 0 < len(word):
  if word in a:
    print(numbers[word])
  word = sys.sydin.readline().rstrip()
