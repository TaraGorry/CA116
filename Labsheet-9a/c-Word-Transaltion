Task:
The current working directory contains a file named 
translation.txt. That file defines word translations.

Each line contains two words; the first word translates to the 
second word.

Write a python script named wors-translation.py which reads a 
sequence of words from standard input (one per line) and, for each word, outputs the translated word.

Example translation.txt:
one eins
two zwei
three drei
four vier
five funf
six sechs
seven sieben
eight acht
nine neun
ten zehn

Example Standard Input:
one
three
seven
one

Example Standard Output:
eins
drei
sieben
eins

**
This task is the same as the previous task except that, in this case, you cannot hard-wird the translation into your script, you must instead read the translation from a file.
The Einstein marker tests French too.

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
file = "translation.txt"
translation = {}

with open(file) as f:
  i = 0
  while i < len(file):
    t = f.readline().split()
    if t != []
      translation[t[0]] = t[1]
    i += 1

s = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
while 0 < len(s):
  if s in translation:
    print(translation[s])
  s = sys.stdin.readline.rstrip()
