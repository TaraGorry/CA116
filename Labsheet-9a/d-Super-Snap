Background:
Super snap is like the game snap except that the matching cards 
(or words, in out case) need not be adjacent; there may be 
intervening cards (or words).

Task:
Standard input consists of a sequencs of words, one per line.

Write a python script named super-snap.py which outputs the message indicated in the first example below when it encounters the first super snap.

Your script should produce no output if no super snap is encountered.

Example Standard Input 1:
rabbit
dog
cat
mouse
elephant
dog
cat

Example Standard Output 1:
snap: dog

Example Standard Input 2:
rabbit
dog
cat
mouse
elephant
mole
sheep
goat

Example Standard Output 2 (empty):
# Do not produce any output at all.

**
Your solution to this problem can be structured in several ways; however, fundamentally, it's always linear search.
Use a dictionary to store the words which have been seen previously.
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
words = sys.stdin.readlines()
seen = {}

i = 0
while i < len(words):
  word = words[i].rstrip()
  if word not in seen:
    seen[word] = True
  elif word in seen:
    print("snap: " + word)
    i = len(words)
  i += 1
