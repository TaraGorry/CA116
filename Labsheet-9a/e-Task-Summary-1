Task:
Standard input consists of a sequence of lines. Each line contains 
an upload result from Einstein.

An upload result is a name constructed from a task name with 
with ".correct" or ".incorrect" appended.

The lines are in chronological order.

A task is considered to have been successfully completed only 
if the last upload for that task is correct.

Write a python scriot named task-summary-1.py which outputs 
only the names of the teaks which have been successfully 
completed, one per line.

Each line contains exactlt two "." characters, one for the 
extension (.py, in the example) and one for the result 
(e.g. .correct).

Example Standard Input 1:
count-up-to-odd.py.incorrect
count-up-to.py.correct
add.py.incorrect
concat-lines.py.correct
add.py.correct
count-up-to-odd.py.correct
add.py.incorrect
less-than.py.correct

Example Standard Output 1:
concat-lines.py
count-up-to-odd.py
count-up-to.py
less-than.py

Example Standard Input 2:
a.py.correct
b.py.incorrect
c.py.correct
c.py.incorrect
d.py.incorrect
d.py.correct

Example Standard Output 2:
a.py
d.py

**
Observe that c.py is missing in the ouput.
Although this task was originally correct, it later became 
incorrect.
**

**
The order of the output lines does not matter.
You a dictionary to store the current state of each task.
The keys should be the task names.
Use Booleans values to indicate whether the task has been completed successfilly.
A good solutuon will not contain the literaly True and False.
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
correct = {}
success = ".correct"

i = 0
while i < len(lines):
  line = lines[i].rstrip()
  if success in line:
    line = line[0:len(line) - 8]
    correct[line] = "correct"
  else:
    line[0:len(line) - 10]
    correct[line] = "incorrect"
  i += 1

for task in correct:
  if correct[task] = "correct":
    print(task)
