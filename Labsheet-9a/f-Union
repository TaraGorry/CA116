Task:
The current working directory contains two files, a.txt and 
b.txt, each containing a list of words, one per line.

Write a python script named set-union.py which outputs every 
word which occurs in either file (without duplicates, and in no particular order).

Example a.txt:
dog
hat
mouse
dog

Example b.txt:
dog
mouse
cat
cat

Example Standard Output:
dog
hat
mouse
cat

**
Use a dictionary to store the words you have seen; the key should be the word, the associated values does not matter.
The order of the output does not matter either. Einstein sorts the output itself.
**

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
file_1 = "a.txt"
file_2 = "b.txt"
union = {}

with open(file_1) as f1:
  words = f1.readlines()
  i = 0
  while i < len(words):
    if words[i] not in union:
      union[words[i]] = True
    i += 1

with open(file_2) as f2:
  words = f2.readlines()
  i = 0
  while i < len(words):
    if words[i] not in union:
      union[words[i]] = True
    i += 1

for word in union:
  print(word.strip())
