Task:
The current working directory contains two files, a.txt and 
b.txt, each containing a list of words, one per line.

Write a python script named set-difference.py which outputs every word withc occors in a.txt but not in b.txt (without duplicates, and in no particular order).

Example a.txt:
dog
hat
mouse
dog

Example b.txt:
dog
mouse
cat
cat

Example Standard Output:
hat

Solution:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

file_1 = "a.txt"
file_2 = "b.txt"
a = {}
b = {}
printed = {}

with open(file_1) as f1:
  word1 = f1.readlines()
  i = 0
  while i < len(word1):
    if word1[i] not in a:
      a[word1[i]] = True
    i += 1

with open(file_2) as f2:
  word2 = f2.readlines()
  i = 0
  while i < len(word2):
    if word2[i] not in b:
      b[word2[i]] = True

for word in a:
  if (word not in b) and (word not in printed):
    print(word.strip())
    printed[word] = True
