Task:
The current working directory contains two files, a.txt and 
b.txt, each containing a list of words, one per line.

Write a python script named set-disjoint.py which outputs either the message "disjoint" or the message "intersecting" depending upon whether the two lists are digjoint or not.

Sets are disjoint if they have no elements (words, here) in common.

Example a.txt:
dog
hat
mouse
dog

Example b.txt:
dog
mouse
cat
cat

Example Standard Output:
intersecting

with open("a.txt", "r") as file_1, open("b.txt", "r") as file_2:
  set_a = set(file_1.read().splitlines())
  set_b = set(file_2.read().splitlines())

if set_a.isdisjoint(set_b):
  print("disjoint")
else:
  print("intersecting")
